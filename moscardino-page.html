        <h2>Moscardino</h2>
        <h4>Use of simple shape</h4>
  
        <p> Iacchetti brings new enjoyment to eating with Moscardino, with its untraditional form, the natural and humanistic hold contains an amusement in how you use it. Compact and handy, Moscardino is designed to respond to the changing habits of eating and receiving by taking the classic archetype of the spoon and fork and condensed them into a simple but unorthodox form. Its compact and simple shape is not only elegant but saves the use of excess material. Iacchetti took a boring, everyday item that everyone is familiar with and expanded on it to produce something novel.
</p>
<h4>Excellent choice of material</h4>
        <p>As a product meant to be thrown away, the first run of moscardino was made of biodegradable corn-starch material instead the traditional single-use plastics, and then was later cast with steel to be reused more easily to further reduce waste and the damage to the enviornment. </p>

<h4>Use of irony to the design</h4>
        <p>The name 'moscardino' has a meaning of 'little octopus', a type of octopus that is used in cuisine. This added a touch of irony to the design by relating the appearance of cutlery and food, and also added the sense of enjoyment when using the design.</p>

      	<h2>Why would it be considered 'signature'</h2>
		<p>Creating a dual-purpose utensil is efficient, useful, and fun for social settings where it is used, but also cuts down on waste. Commenting on the longevity of single-use objects and how we can improve them to create memorable experiences and make people want to keep and use them again. Moscardino is a good example of using archetypes while expanding and creating an entirely new product and experience, it shows Iacchettiâ€™s value in the interaction and connection between the audience and the design, hence making it a signature.
