        <h2>Meda Sofa</h2>
        <h4>Furniture with freedom in definition</h4>
  
        <p> The meda sofa is a two-seater sofa characterized by a system of modular joints, moveable cushions, and a wooden base. With Iacchetti's pursue on the idea of “a sofa for service, not to be served”, the sofa's highly adaptive multi-density polyurethane foam allows people to construct environments of their own, and optimize the layout for future functional or decorative needs. Iaacheti’s meda sofa illustrates his approach to a design idea as an occasion; for meeting and exchange. 
</p>
<h4>A sofa that brings out your inner child</h4>
        <p>
        The meda sofa is an interruption of the logical sense that transcends more than solely comfort, where one can be at rest and play. This is not just a conventional sofa, it can be be transformed in multiple configurations such as a guest bed, or even a kid's playground depend on how you arrange the cushions and creating unusual spaces of relation, this brings out the child-like drive in people that combines practicality and nostalgia people want to hold onto.

      	<h2>Why would it be considered 'signature'</h2>
		<p>Iacchetti reinvented archetypical forms into something endlessly reconfigurable, he knows that the relationship one forms with a product is what makes it last, so he considers the experience and needs. At the same time, he does not pretend to understand everyone’s needs, so creates products that can be reconfigured, and used in reversible and unique ways by each person. This makes them more lasting and impactful, as each person gets to make them their own. The meda sofa extends a sofa's basic function to create relationships with people, becoming welcome characters instead of mere objects, this makes it a signature piece with how Iacchetti integrated the complexity of everyday objects and their influence on our lives through his design.
