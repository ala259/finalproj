        <h2>Giulio Iacchetti</h2>
        <h4>Brief introduction</h4>
        <p>Giulio Iacchetti is an Italian industrial designer, whose work is centered around portraying the culture’s rich history and profound respect for Italian craftsmanship. In recognizing the value of creating products that withstand different contexts in space and time, he reinforces this idea of everyday objects as being “companions of life,” where both can harmoniously coexist. </p>
		<h4>Design philosophy</h4>
		<p>Since his beginnings, Iacchetti’s work has been used as a means of being transparent about the vast network of artists that he collaborates with in the field. Where mass produced designs tend to often lack substance and curiosity, Iacchetti’s goal of restoring objects to uphold their humanistic features is prominent in his attentiveness to achieve qualitative excellence through wise-use of materials. Recognizing that the key to product longevity is providing roles that go beyond mere function, he is constantly keen on exploring new ways in which design can be progressed by raising the level of challenge, even if it means defying logic.</p>
		<h4>Influence in field of design</h4>
        <p>Giulio Iacchetti believes in collaboration between designers and there is more to be preserved than to be created, and this belief further encouraged the field to emphasize more on reservation and collaboration in design.</p>
